            <h2>About Paleontology</h2>
            <p>
                Paleontology is the scientific study of life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the Holocene Epoch (roughly 11,700 years ago). It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms' evolution and interactions with each other and their environments (their paleoecology).
            </p>
            <p>
                Paleontologists work like detectives, piecing together evidence from fossils to reconstruct ancient life forms and environments. They use a variety of scientific techniques including carbon dating, geological analysis, and comparative anatomy to understand the prehistoric world.

            <h2>How Fossils Are Discovered</h2>
            <h3>The Fossilization Process</h3>
            <p>
                Fossilization is a rare event that requires specific conditions. When an organism dies, it must be quickly buried by sediment before decomposition occurs. Over millions of years, minerals replace organic material, turning remains into stone. Only about 1% of all species that ever lived became fossils.
            </p>
            <h3>Fossil Hunting</h3>
            <p>
                Paleontologists search for fossils in sedimentary rock formations, particularly in areas with exposed rock layers. Erosion naturally reveals fossils over time. Major fossil sites include the Badlands of South Dakota, the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, and the Dinosaur Provincial Park in Canada.
            </p>
            <h3>Excavation Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                Once a fossil is discovered, scientists carefully excavate it using specialized tools. Small brushes, picks, and dental tools remove surrounding rock. Larger fossils may be encased in plaster jackets for safe transport to laboratories where detailed study can occur.
